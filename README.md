# SC1015-Student-Alcohol-Consumption

## About this Project
This mini project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science & Artificial Intelligence) will focus on alcohol consumption in students from [Student Alcohol Consumption Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption?resource=download).

## Walkthrough
The portion contains the source code for our entire analysis of the database

1. [Data Extraction & Cleaning](insert file url here)
2. [Exploratory Data Analysis]
3. [Linear Regression]
4. [Requirements for running the Notebook]

## Problem Definition
1. How does alcohol consumption influence the grades of students?
2. Can we predict grades based on a few attributes?

### Variables Used in Dataset:
1. school (student's school)
2. sex - student's sex
3. age - student's age
4. address - student's home address type
5. famsize - family size
6. Pstatus - parent's cohabitation status
7. Medu - mother's education
8. Fedu - father's education
9. traveltime - home to school travel time
10. studytime - weekly study time
11. famrel - quality of family relationships
12. freetime - free time after school
13. goout - going out with friends
14. Dalc - workday alcohol consumption
15. Walc - weekend alcohol consumption
16. health - current health status
17. absences - number of school absences
18. G1 - first period grade
19. G2 - second period grade
20. G3 - final grade

## Models Used
1. Linear Regression
2. Multiple Linear Regression

## Conclusion
- Alcohol consumption has a small effect on studentsâ€™ grades
- Other factors like study time & parents' education level also play an equal or more significant part to determining academic performance
